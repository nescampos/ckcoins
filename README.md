# ckCoins

**ckCoins** is a decentralized stablecoins platform, to allow create, manage, mint and burn new stablecoins.
In this first version, just with one example stablecoin in the project (the vault and liquidity in this version just use the demo stablecoin, called TAL, with ckBTC).

## Available options

- Open a vault
- Borrow from a vault
- Repay to a vault
- Add margin to a vault
- Close a vault
- Provide liquidity
- Withdraw liquidity
- Claim liquidity returns

About liquidity: Users can provide liquidity to the liquidity pool in the form of stablecoin. The liquidity pool is used to liquidate the vault whose collateral ratio falls below 110%, hence buying ckBTC at a discount.
